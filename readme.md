# Heads Or Tails

This repo is a simple script that flips a coin X times and shows the ratio of numbers of heads/tails by times flipped in percentage.

I created this repo due to an good book called "How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking" by Jordan Ellenberg where he tells that the initial results of flipping a coin are not 50% heads and 50% tails. But, the more you flip, the more the result will be close to 50%.

PS: Something like that, I don't remember the exact words.

This script is a simple way to test this "theory". I hope you enjoy it.

## How to run

With clojure installed, run:
